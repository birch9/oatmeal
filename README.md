# oatmeal
Oatmeal is an experiment in procedural narrative generation designed to strike a good balance between handcrafted prose and re-usable narrative structures.
All information about the world is stored in the form of a graph. When an event is activated either by user input or an automated process the event modifies the world and updates the user with a text prompt.
This design builds on the enitity component system commonly found in roguelike games and in theory could be used to simulate any complex system.
